# SUMO-OpenstreetMap
# Simulation of Traffic Intersections Using SUMO and OpenStreetMap

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic density and queue lengths at **rural, urban, and metro intersections** using **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** and **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**. The goal is to identify traffic congestion patterns and optimize signal control for improved flow and reduced delays.

## üéØ Objectives
- Extract real-world **intersection layouts** from OpenStreetMap for accurate traffic modeling.
- Simulate **traffic density and vehicle flow** using SUMO.
- Analyze **queue lengths** to optimize signal timing and congestion management.

## üîß Tools & Technologies
- **SUMO**: Traffic simulation software
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: Real-world road network data
- **Python** (for automation)

# Steps

## Importing the osm map
This steps consists of importing our OSM map that will be in xml format :

1. go to [OpenStreetMAP!](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) website.
2. slect the region you want to export and click export button to save your .*osm map file

![Schenario](https://github.com/xobx-cherif/Sumo-OpenStreetMap/blob/master/OSM.png)

3. Use the netconvert tool to convert the osm map to a SUMO network file using the following command

```shell
netconvert --osm-files OSM_file_name.osm -o network_file_name.net.xml
```
4. OSM-data not only contains the road network but also a wide range of additional polygons such as buildings and rivers. These polygons can be imported using POLYCONVERT and then added to a SUMO configuration file(*.sumocfg).

you can use the .poly.xml file from this repository this file contains some basic polygons description like the water, buildings ... etc

now we are ready to generate our poly.xml file by typing the following command:
```shell
polyconvert --net-file network_file_name.net.xml --osm-files OSM_file_name.osm --type-file typemap.xml -o poly_file_name.poly.xml
```
5. At this point we have our scenario street network file, as we know we need and additional description file that describes the vehicles and their routes the file named .rou.xml
For these purpose we can youse the randomtrip tool to generate a random route scenario by typing the following command:

```shell
python {PATH TO SUMO}/tools/randomTrips.py -n network_file_name.net.xml -r route_file_name.rou.xml -e 100 -l 

```
6. At this point we generated our routes file, and we just need one more final file to be ready to execute our simulation.

Now we should put all together in a sumo configuration file that will tell our simulator about the route and network files that we want to use in our simulation the file should look like the following:

```xml
<configuration>
 <input>
  <net-file value="network_file_name.net.xml"/> 
  <route-files value="route_file_name.rou.xml"/> 		
  <additional-files value="poly_file_name.poly.xml"/>
 </input>
 <time>
  <begin value="0"/>
  <end value="1000"/>
  <step-length value="0.1"/> 
 </time>
</configuration>
```
This file should be saved with the extension *.sumocfg

7. Now we are ready to lunch our simulation using the following command :

```shell
sumo-gui config_file_name.sumocfg
```
And here are the cars mooving :D

## üìä Results & Analysis
### üîπ Traffic Density & Queue Lengths
- **Metro areas** showed the highest congestion.
- **Urban areas** had moderate traffic flow.
- **Rural areas** had the least congestion.

### üîπ Optimization Strategies
- **Metro Areas**: Adaptive traffic signal control
- **Urban Areas**: Smart routing algorithms
- **Rural Areas**: Minimal intervention needed

## üìå Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **SUMO and OpenStreetMap** can be used to analyze and optimize **traffic flow** at different intersection types. Future work can explore AI-based traffic light optimization to reduce congestion further.
